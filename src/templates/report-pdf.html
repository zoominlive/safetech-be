        <h3>Risk Assessment Summary:</h3>
        <p>Based on the findings of this assessment, the following risk factors have been identified:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Risk:</strong> Areas where no designated substances were identified or where materials are in good condition and unlikely to be disturbed</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Risk:</strong> Areas where designated substances are present but in good condition, requiring standard control measures during work activities</li>
            <li><strong>High Risk:</strong> Areas where designated substances are present in poor condition or where significant disturbance is anticipated during construction activities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Material Condition Assessment:</h3>
        <p>The condition of identified materials has been evaluated using standard industry criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Good Condition:</strong> Materials are intact, undamaged, and unlikely to release fibers or particles under normal conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Fair Condition:</strong> Materials show minor damage or wear but are generally intact</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Condition:</strong> Materials are significantly damaged, deteriorated, or friable and may release fibers or particles</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Exposure Assessment:</h3>
        <p>The potential for exposure to designated substances during construction activities has been evaluated based on the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type and condition of materials present</li>
            <li>Nature and extent of planned construction activities</li>
            <li>Work methods and procedures to be employed</li>
            <li>Environmental conditions and ventilation</li>
            <li>Duration and frequency of work activities</li>
            <li>Number of workers potentially exposed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Health Effects and Exposure Limits:</h3>
        <p>Exposure to designated substances can have various health effects depending on the substance, concentration, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility. The following exposure limits and health effects are relevant to the materials identified in this assessment:</p>
        
        <h4>Asbestos:</h4>
        <p>Asbestos exposure can cause serious health effects including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. The Ontario exposure limit for asbestos is 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc) as an 8-hour time-weighted average. All work with asbestos-containing materials must be conducted in accordance with Regulation 278/05 requirements.</p>
        
        <h4>Lead:</h4>
        <p>Lead exposure can affect the nervous system, kidneys, and other organs. The Ontario exposure limit for lead is 0.05 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/mÂ³) as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Lead-safe work practices must be implemented during renovation activities involving lead-containing materials.</p>
        
        <h4>Silica:</h4>
        <p>Crystalline silica exposure can cause silicosis, lung cancer, and other respiratory diseases. The Ontario exposure limit for respirable crystalline silica is 0.025 mg/mÂ³ as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Appropriate dust control measures must be implemented during activities that may generate silica dust.</p>
        
        <h4>Mercury:</h4>
        <p>Mercury exposure can affect the nervous system, kidneys, and other organs. The Ontario exposure limit for mercury is 0.025 mg/mÂ³ as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Special handling procedures are required for mercury-containing equipment.</p>
        
        <h3>Environmental Considerations:</h3>
        <p>In addition to worker health and safety, the assessment considered potential environmental impacts of designated substances. Proper disposal procedures must be followed for all hazardous materials to prevent environmental contamination and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.</p>
        
        <p>Waste management procedures must be established for all designated substances and hazardous materials identified in this assessment. Disposal must be conducted at approved facilities in accordance with applicable regulations.</p>
